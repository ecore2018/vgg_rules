vgg_rules
==============

This is an experimental project for implementing rule engine(business_rule) in Python.

The project is a console application based on Django 1.6, implementing promotion calculations in business system:
* All goods are priced individually. Some items are also multi-priced based on quantity bought. Buy n of them, and theyâ€™ll cost you y cents.
* Pricing changes frequently
* Items could have multiple rules

The rule script in json format is saved in database and will be read and implemented to all the items ordered.

Rule Script Examples:

The "name" in "condtions" is defined in python class `OrderDetailVariables`. The "name" in "action" is defined in python class `OrderDetailActions`.

####1. Buy 3 oranges in a group at price $1.80 each(10% off).

```json

{ "conditions": { "all": [
      { "name": "product_code",
        "operator": "equal_to",
        "value": "ORANGE"
      },
      { "name": "product_amount",
        "operator": "greater_than_or_equal_to",
        "value": 3
      }
  ]},
  "actions": [
      { "name": "buy_group_and_cheaper",
        "params": {"group_count": 3,  "sale_price": 180}
      }
  ]
}
```
